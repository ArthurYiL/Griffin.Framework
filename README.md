Griffin.Framework
=================

Griffin.Framework is an open source library built using the experiences from all my previous libraries. I will merge all other libraries into this one. 


#Stable parts

Libraries which have been completed.

## Griffin.Data

A data mapper which works as an extension to ADO.NET. That gives you full control while not having to take care of mappings or CRUD operations.

## Griffin.Networking

High performance networking layer which makes it very easy to allow .NET applications to communicate.

Supports HTTP, STOMP and our own MicroMsg transport protocol.
