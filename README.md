Griffin.Framework
=================

Griffin.Framework will be an open source library based on all my Griffin projects. Unlike my other libraries this is no longer an experiment library. All lessons learned from my other libraries will applied in this new one.

It will be actively maintained, have good test coverage and ***commercial support***.

First out is the Griffin.Networking and Griffin.Data replacements. Consider them to be tech previews until otherwise said so.

Commercial support is available through Gauffin Interactive AB: support@gauffin.com.
