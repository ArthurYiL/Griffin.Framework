Griffin.Framework
=================

Griffin.Framework is an open source library built using the experiences from all my previous libraries. I will merge all other libraries into this one. Next up is a complete rewrite of Griffin.Network, it will be faster and more stable.

Commercial support is available through Gauffin Interactive AB: support@gauffin.com.
