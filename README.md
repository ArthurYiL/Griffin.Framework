Griffin.Framework
=================

Griffin.Framework will be an open source library based on all my Griffin projects. 

It will be actively maintained, have good test coverage and ***commercial support***.

First out is the Griffin.Networking and Griffin.Data replacements. Consider them to be tech previews until otherwise said so.

Commercial support is available through Gauffin Interactive AB: support@gauffin.com.
